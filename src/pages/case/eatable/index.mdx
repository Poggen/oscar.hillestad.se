# Eatable

This summer, I built a website for a company named EaTable, who needed help with building a stronger brand and attracting new customers & partners. On the first day of my summer vacation, I started desiging and building, using React/Next.js, Sanity & Framer motion.

## Animation

Framer-Motion is an animation library for React that makes it easy to declaratively orchestrate stunning animations. For Eatable, I used it for everything from eye-catching, scroll-driven parallax animations, to playful, staggered reveal animations.

## CMS

Not wanting to limit themselves to the traditional CMS quadrant, Sanity pitches themselves as a “platform for structured content”. Based on JavaScript & React, this notion of structured data is what really makes them stand out from more traditional CMS:es, where everything is thought of as templates and page types. Even though I ended up building a relatively competent page builder in Sanity, the core concept of declaring data once and utilizing relations between various objects in the data model to create a great user, developer and editor experience, and then being able to use it across multiple places on a website (or even multiple platforms, such as apps or print) really spoke out to me.

## Editor experience

- Page builder
- PortableText
- Live previews

## Developer experience

### Declarative, rich schema

TBD

### Groq

Having worked a lot with graphQL in the past, I was already sold on the flexibility of query languages that gives you what you want in the shape you want it.

ISR ~125 pages x 2 locales

Flexible I18n
The site had to support multiple locales and Sanity’s flexible toolkit for i18n turned out to be a perfect match for this. Over the course of the project, I ended up using most of the internationalization strategies available in Sanity, depending on context;

- Document-based (whole document / entity, like a page, exists in one version per locale)
- Field-based (most fields in the data model are shared regardless of locale (eg. images, content order/structure, etc), but text fields are made translatable on a case-by-case basis
- Site-wide strings (texts that are used across the page in various ways, such as form placeholders, slugs, static headings in specific templates, etc)

A logo and two colors
From a design standpoint, all I had in terms of a brief was a logotype and two colors. The path from there to a cohesive website experience with XX+ components was everything but easy and took some iterations to get right. I opted to use tailwind’s easy-to-use class based design system as a starting point, and worked with shades of the two colors to craft a color palette that could be used in a wider range of use-cases.
