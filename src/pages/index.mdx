<div class="lead">
  Feeling just as comfortable pushing code as I do in a board room, I've always
  taken great pride in making sure my development and sales teams aim to achieve
  excellence in all the digital experiences we deliver. Being the link between
  management/sales and IT/product development is my native habitat, and I enjoy
  the subtle, but important art of adapting a narrative depending on the context
  and audience. I'd like to think my colleagues find me an energetic and
  ambitious team player, who loves Mondays and likes to put a smile on as many
  faces as possible over the course of a work day. It's important for me to
  surround myself with like-minded people, who share my vision of building
  something great and having fun doing it.
